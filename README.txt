##################empirical data############
#all data used in this paper are taken from {Szappanos,2011}

for both data files we exclude essential genes and genes associated with blocked reactions  
and then calculated epistasis

combined_data_highconfidence.txt  is used for Epistasis analysis 

sgadata_metabolic_array_Deya.txt is used for is used for synthetic lethal analysis 


################## model##################
 - growth medium was set up to mimic the one used in the experiment 
 - 5 genes were deleted to mimic the strain background used in the experiments.

#Rdata files with the yeast7.6  model

##################kcat+molecular weights##################

experimental kcat values for 535 enzymes and molecular weights are taken from {Desouki, 2016}
for the remaining enzymes, we use the median of the 535 known values
